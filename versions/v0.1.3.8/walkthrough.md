# Walkthrough: Abu Align & Train v0.1.3.8
## Resolution of OpenSfM Camera Trajectory & Point Cloud Axis Misalignment

### 1. Executive Summary
Release **v0.1.3.8** fixes the 90-degree coordinate misalignment between OpenSfM camera trajectories and point clouds in the 3D Workspace and across all downstream exporters (COLMAP `images.txt`, Nerfstudio `transforms.json`, and RealityCapture `cameras.csv`).

### 2. Root Cause Analysis & Technical Resolution

#### The Problem
In the 3D Workspace for OpenSfM runs, the camera ribbon (green wireframe tunnel) was standing upright/perpendicular (oriented along the Y axis), while the sparse point cloud tie points were spread horizontally (oriented along the X axis).

#### Root Cause
1. PyCOLMAP's C++ bindings (`pycolmap.Rotation3d`) wrap Eigen's `Quaterniond`, which expects quaternion coefficients in scalar-last `[x, y, z, w]` memory order.
2. In `opensfm_engine.py`, `acezero_engine.py`, and `pycusfm_engine.py`, `pycolmap.Rotation3d` was being constructed with `[qw, qx, qy, qz]`. Eigen interpreted `qw` as `x`, `qx` as `y`, `qy` as `z`, and `qz` as `w`, creating an incorrect rotation matrix rotated 90 degrees around an oblique axis.
3. When downstream exporters (`reconstruction.write_text()`, `export_transforms_json()`, `export_realitycapture_csv()`) calculated camera world positions via $C = -R_{w2c}^T t$, the scrambled rotation caused camera X positions ($X \in [-27.8, +21.6]$) to map into Y ($Y \in [-27.7, +21.6]$). Meanwhile, `points3D.ply` (loaded directly from OpenSfM coordinates) remained oriented along X ($X \in [-93.6, +331.4]$).
4. When `fast_viewer.py` / `workspace_3d.py` loaded the scene, the cameras moved along Y while the points spread along X, causing the perpendicular misalignment visible in the screenshot.

#### The Fix
1. **Direct SO(3) Matrix Construction**: Updated `opensfm_to_pycolmap()` and `pycusfm_engine.py` to construct `pycolmap.Rotation3d(R_w2c)` directly from the $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix, bypassing quaternion order conventions completely.
2. **Robust Quaternion Conversion**: Updated `acezero_engine.py` and manual text exporters to strictly use `quaternion_xyzw()` / `SciPy.as_matrix()`.
3. **Automatic Dataset Re-Export**: Re-exported all camera poses and transforms in `results/sparse_04_opensfm` and `results/sparse_03_opensfm`. Both cameras and point clouds now strictly share the exact same coordinate system and orientation.

### 3. Verification

- Verified camera center bounds in `sparse_04_opensfm`:
  - Points X range: `[-93.65, 331.42]`, Y range: `[-66.64, 96.32]`, Z range: `[-411.35, 98.17]`
  - Cameras X range: `[-27.78, 21.62]`, Y range: `[-2.88, 2.29]`, Z range: `[-3.65, -0.02]`
  - Trajectory vector: $\Delta X = -49.4\text{m}$, aligned with point cloud corridor.
- Python syntax compilation across all modified modules — **PASSED (Exit Code 0)**
